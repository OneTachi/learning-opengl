# Learning OpenGL

This repository holds my current progress going through the lessons and exercises on https://learnopengl.com/ including all my personal notes/understanding of the lessons included as comments. The directory is divided by each lesson listed on the site. The purpose of this is for future reference and safekeeping in case my SSD fries on me. 

## How to run

Type in the command `./run filename` with the filename being any of the .cpp files. After exiting the program, any produced files should automatically be cleaned.
